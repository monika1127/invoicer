# Invoicer

This application is an excercise to practice React.
I have learned how to use React Context, React Router, React Redux, Formik, Sass.

## Usage

To start the project run

```bash
    npm start
```

and

```bash
    npm run json-server
```

Not all visible options are avaliable. This app allows to:
 * display list of invoices
 * check the invoice details
 * add new invoice
 * add new contractor
